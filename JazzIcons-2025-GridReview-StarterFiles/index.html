          <img src="images/nina-simone.jpg" alt="Nina Simone" />
          <p>One of the most influential recording artists of all time, Simone possessed a magnificent intensity that turns everything, even the most simple mundane phrase or lyric into a radiant poetic message.</p>

          <img src="images/diamanda-galas.jpg" alt="Diamanda Galas" />
          <p>Galás has been described as “capable of the most unnerving vocal terror”, with her three and a half octave vocal range. Her works largely concentrate on the topics of AIDS, mental illness, despair, injustice, condemnation, and loss of dignity. She has worked with many avant-garde composers.</p>

          <img src="images/anita-oday-2.jpg" alt="Anita O'Day" />
          <p>O'Day was admired for her rhythm and dynamics, and for shattering the traditional image of the “girl singer”. Refusing to pander to any gender stereotype, O'Day presented herself as a “hip” jazz musician, in a band jacket and skirt as opposed to an evening gown.</p>

          <p>Also known as the “First Lady of Song”, “Queen of Jazz”, and “Lady Ella”, Fitzgerald had a vocal range spanning three octaves (D♭3 to D♭6), and was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a “horn-like” improvisational ability.</p>

          <p>One of few guitarists in the first wave of free jazz in the 1960s, Sharrock was known for his incisive, heavily chorded attack, his highly-amplified bursts of wild feedback, and for his use of saxophone-like lines played loudly on guitar.</p>

          <p>In the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of The Boston Globe, “[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.” Duke Ellington called his music “American Music” rather than jazz.</p>

          <p>Nicknamed “Lady Day” by her friend and musical partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz and pop singing. Critic John Bush wrote that Holiday “changed the art of American pop vocals forever.” She died with $.70 in the bank.</p>

          <img src="images/miles-davis.jpg" alt="Miles Davis" />
          <p>“So What” has only two chords: D-7 and E♭-7. Davis said that the inspiration for the album came from a lamellophone player he heard in a Ballet Africaine performance, and a childhood memory of walking down a dark country road in Arkansas, hearing gospel music.</p>

          <p>Parker introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas, including rapidly passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. He remains probably the most influential saxophone player of all time.</p>

          <img src="images/thelonious-monk.jpg" alt="Thelonious Monk" />
          <p>His compositions are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists, and are consistent with Monk's unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of silences and hesitations.</p>

          <img src="images/dizzy-gillespie.jpg" alt="Dizzy Gillespie" />
          <p>Gillespie was such a complex player that contemporaries ended up copying Miles Davis and Fats Navarro instead; it was not until Jon Faddis's emergence in the 1970s that Dizzy's style was successfully recreated. He was described as the “Sound of Surprise”.</p>

          <p>“People are so obsessed with the surface that they can’t see the connections, but they are there. When I sit down and make music, a lot of things come together. Sometimes it falls a little bit toward the jazz, sometimes it falls toward rock, sometimes it doesn’t fall anywhere, it’s just floating in limbo.”</p>
